      <h4>Landlsides</h4>
      <p>India has the highest mountain chain on earth, the Himalayas, which are formed due to collision of Indian and
        Eurasian plate, the northward movement of the Indian plate towards China causes continuous stress on the rocks
        rendering them friable, weak and prone to landslides and earthquakes. The slow motion of the Indian crust,
        about 5 cm/year accumulates stress to which natural disasters are attributed. Some landslides make unique, and
        unparalleled catastrophes. Landslides and avalanches are among the major hydro-geological hazards that affect
        large parts of India besides the Himalayas, the Northeastern hill ranges, the Western Ghats, the Nilgiris, the
        Eastern Ghats and the Vindhyans, in that order, covering about 15 % of the landmass. The Himalayas alone count
        for landslides of every fame, name and description- big and small, quick and creeping, ancient and new. The
        Northeastern region is badly affected by landslide problems of a bewildering variety. Landslides in the
        Darjeeling district of West Bengal as also those in Sikkim, Mizoram, Tripura, Meghalaya, Assam, Nagaland and
        Arunachal Pradesh pose chronic problems, causing recurring economic losses worth billions of rupees. A
        different variety of landslides, characterized by a lateritic cap, pose constant threat to the Western Ghats
        in the South, along the steep slopes overlooking the Konkan coast besides Nilgiris, which is highly landslide
        prone.</p>
      <p>Some spectacular events of tragedies are reported as Varnavat landslide, Uttarkashi District, Malpha
        landslide Pithoragarh district, Okhimath landslide in Chamoli district, UK and Paglajhora in Darjeeling
        district as well as Sikkim, Aizawl sports complex, Mizoram.These are some of the more recent examples of
        landslides. The problem therefore needs to be tackled for mitigation and management for which hazard zones
        have to be identified and specific slides to be stabilized and managed in addition to monitoring and early
        warning systems to be placed at selected sites. The Photograph of Okhimath landslide which formed a lake in
