      <h4>Vulnerability Profile of india</h4>
      <p>India is vulnerable, in varying degrees, to a large number of disasters. More than 58.6 per cent of the
        landmass is prone to earthquakes of moderate to very high intensity; over 40 million hectares (12%) of its
        land is prone to floods and river erosion; close to 5,700 kms, out of the 7,516 kms long coastline is prone to
        cyclones and tsunamis; 68% of its cultivable area is vulnerable to droughts; and, its hilly areas are at risk
        from landslides and avalanches. Moreover, India is also vulnerable to Chemical, Biological, Radiological and
        Nuclear (CBRN) emergencies and other man-made disasters.</p>
      <p>Disaster risks in India are further compounded by increasing vulnerabilities related to changing demographics
        and socio-economic conditions, unplanned urbanization, development within high-risk zones, environmental
        degradation, climate change, geological hazards, epidemics and pandemics. Clearly, all these contribute to a
        situation where disasters seriously threaten Indiaâ€™s economy, its population and sustainable development.</p>
