      <h4>Cyclones</h4>
      <p>Cyclones are caused by atmospheric disturbances around a low-pressure area distinguished by swift and often
        destructive air circulation. Cyclones are usually accompanied by violent storms and bad weather. The air
        circulates inward in an anticlockwise direction in the Northern hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern
        hemisphere. Cyclones are classified as: (i) extra tropical cyclones (also called temperate cyclones); and (ii)
        tropical cyclones. The word Cyclone is derived from the Greek word Cyclos meaning the coils of a snake. It was
        coined by Henry Peddington because the tropical storms in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea appear like
        coiled serpents of the sea.</p>


      <h4>Classification</h4>
      <p>Cyclones are classified as extra tropical cyclones (also called temperate cyclones); and tropical cyclones.
        The World Meteorological Organisation (WMO, 1976) uses the term 'Tropical Cyclone’ to cover weather systems in
        which winds exceed ‘Gale Force’ (minimum of 34 knots or 63 kph). Tropical cyclones are the progeny of ocean
        and atmosphere, powered by the heat from the sea; and driven by easterly trades and temperate westerlies, high
        planetary winds and their own fierce energy.</p>

      <h4>In India, cyclones are classified by:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Strength of associated winds.</li>
        <li>Storm surges</li>
        <li>Exceptional rainfall occurrences.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Extra tropical cyclones</b> occur in temperate zones and high latitude regions, though they are known to
        originate in the Polar Regions. Cyclones that developin the regions between the Tropics of Capricorn and
        Cancer are called tropical cyclones. Tropical cyclones are large-scale weather systems developing over
        tropical or subtropical waters, where they get organized into surface wind circulation.</p>

      <h4>Worldwide terminology</h4>
      <p>Cyclones are given many names in different regions of the world – They are known as typhoons in the China Sea
        and Pacific Ocean; hurricanes in the West Indian islands in the Caribbean Sea and Atlantic Ocean; tornados in
        the Guinea lands of West Africa and southern USA.; willy-willies in north-western Australia and tropical
        cyclones in the Indian Ocean.</p>

      <h4>Indian Meteorological Department</h4>
      <p>The criteria below has been formulated by the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), which classifies the
        low pressure systems in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea on the basis of capacity to damage, which is
        adopted by the WMO.</p>

      <b>Storm surges (tidal waves) are defined as the rise in sea level above the normally predicted astronomical
        tide. Major factors include:</b>

      <ul>
        <li>A fall in the atmospheric pressure over the sea surface</li>
        <li>Effect of the wind</li>
        <li>Influence of the sea bed</li>
        <li>A funnelling effect</li>
        <li>The angle and speed at which the storm approaches the coast</li>
        <li>The Tides</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The very high specific humidity condenses into exceptionally large raindrops and giant cumulus clouds,
        resulting in high precipitation rates. When a cyclone makes landfall, rain rapidly saturates the catchment
        areas and the rapid runoff may extensively flood the usual water sources or create new ones.</p>

      <h4>How Cyclones are formed</h4>
      <p>The development cycle of tropical cyclones may be divided into three stages:</p>

      <b>Formation and Initial Development Stage</b>
      <p>The formation and initial development of a cyclonic storm depends upon various conditions. These are:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>A warm sea (a temperature in excess of 26 degrees Celsius to a depth of 60 m) with abundant and turbulent
          transfer of water vapour to the overlying atmosphere by evaporation.</li>
        <li>Atmospheric instability encouraging formation of massive vertical cumulus clouds due to convection with
          condensation of rising air above ocean surface.</li>
      </ul>

      <b>Mature Tropical Cyclones</b>
      <p>When a tropical storm intensifies, the air rises in vigorous thunderstorms and tends to spread out
        horizontally at the tropopause level. Once air spreads out, a positive perturbation pressure at high levels is
        produced, which accelerates the downward motion of air due to convection. With the inducement of subsidence,
        air warms up by compression and a warm ‘Eye’ is generated. Generally, the ‘Eye’ of the storms has three basic
        shapes: (i) circular; (ii) concentric; and (iii) elliptical. The main physical feature of a mature tropical
        cyclone in the Indian Ocean is a concentric pattern of highly turbulent giant cumulus thundercloud bands.</p>

      <b>Modification and Decay</b>
      <p>A tropical cyclone begins to weaken in terms of its central low pressure, internal warmth and extremely high
        speeds, as soon as its source of warm moist air begins to ebb, or is abruptly cut off. This happens after its
        landfall or when it passes over cold waters. The weakening of a cyclone does not mean that the danger to life
        and property is over.</p>

      <b>Indian Context</b>
      <p>The Indian subcontinent is one of the worst affected regions in the world. The subcontinent with a long
        coastline of 8041 kilometres is exposed to nearly 10 per cent of the world’s tropical cyclones. Of these, the
        majority of them have their initial genesis over the Bay of Bengal and strike the East coast of India. On an
        average, five to six tropical cyclones form every year, of which two or three could be severe. More cyclones
        occur in the Bay of Bengal than the Arabian Sea and the ratio is approximately 4:1. Cyclones occur frequently
        on both the coasts (the West coast - Arabian Sea; and the East coast - Bay of Bengal). An analysis of the
        frequency of cyclones on the East and West coasts of India between 1891 and 1990 shows that nearly 262
        cyclones occurred (92 of these severe) in a 50 km wide strip above the East coast. Less severe cyclonic
        activity has been noticed on the West coast, where 33 cyclones occurred the same period, out of which 19 of
        were severe.</p>
      <p>Tropical cyclones occur in the months of May-June and October-November. Cyclones of severe intensity and
        frequency in the North Indian Ocean are bi-modal in character, with their primary peak in November and
        secondary peak in May. The disaster potential is particularly high during landfall in the North Indian Ocean
        (Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea) due to the accompanying destructive wind, storm surges and torrential
        rainfall. Of these, storm surges cause the most damage as sea water inundates low lying areas of coastal
        regions and causes heavy floods, erodes beaches and embankments, destroys vegetation and reduces soil
        fertility.</p>
      <p>Cyclones vary in diameter from 50 to 320 km but their effects dominate thousands of square kilometers of
        ocean surface and the lower atmosphere. The perimeter may measure 1,000 km but the powerhouse is located
        within the 100-km radius. Nearer the Eye, winds may hit at a speed of 320 km. Thus, tropical cyclones,
        characterized by destructive winds, torrential rainfall and storm surges disrupt normal life with the
        accompanying phenomena of floods due to the exceptional level of rainfall and storm surge inundation into
        inland areas. Cyclones are characterized by their devastating potential to damage structures, viz. houses;
        lifeline infrastructure-power and communication towers; hospitals; food storage facilities; roads, bridges and
        culverts; cropss etc. The most fatalities come from storm surges and the torrential rain flooding the lowland
        areas of coastal territories.</p>
